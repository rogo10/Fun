The Secret Santa generator file (both notebook and .py files) uses functions that will take names and their respectives emails, pick their Secret Santa, end emails them. Comments in files are included. In order to let Python connect using your login info, one must access https://myaccount.google.com/security and turn on "Less secure app access". (Only works with Gmail, user can modify connection statements and port number in code if they wish to use email other than Gmail)

reg_fit.py is a small, useful file that will manipulate the x and y to create a regression line(s) based on the parameters.
